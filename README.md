## 1. Introduction
This study guide is a product of the Developers Crowell, a family of software engineers for whom
the craft of code has been transformative, and a community of people who want to share that 
transformation with others. We believe that software engineering is a craft, and that the best
path forward for any engineer is to advance theoria and praxis in tandem to facilitate poiesis.
Our goal is to provide a simple and direct means of advancing theoria, which is the most
neglected of the three for software engineers (henceforth referred to simply as "engineers")
who did not learn their craft in an academic setting.

We are only too aware that this undertaking is beyond any one person or household. If your views
align with what is set out above, please contribute to this guide as you are able and help 
others on their journeys and to improve the state of our craft as a whole. The fruits of this
shared labor will be reaped by us all.

## 2. Organization
This guide is broadly organized by topic and subtopic. Each topic is a directory in the root
of the repository, and each subtopic is a file in that directory. These are the topics as we
have organized them:

### Computer Science
This topic is intended to provide a broad collection of knowledge about the field of computer
science. It is hoped that it will close the gap between the knowledge of engineers who acquired
their craft in an academic setting and those who did not.

### Cross Platform Development
This topic covers issues related to developing software that can be deployed on multiple
platforms and the principles that apply to working on such projects.

### Desktop Engineering
This topic addresses issues related to developing software for desktop platforms, such as
Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

### DevSecOps Engineering
This topic is for issues related to the practice of DevSecOps, which is a portmanteau of
Development, Security, and Operations. This is an inherently broad field of endeavor, and
this topic will serve as a repository of knowledge related to the three disciplines that
coalesce into DevSecOps.

### Documentation
This is one of the most contentious, misunderstood, and maligned topics in software
engineering. It is also one of the most important. This topic will collect our thoughts
about documentation, including documenting code, making diagrams, creating
architecture decision records, recording requirements, producing specifications, and
both technical and not technical writing.

### Mobile Engineering
This topic houses our collective understanding of mobile engineering, which is the practice
of developing software for mobile platforms, such as Android and iOS. It should pair well
with `Cross Platform Development` and `Tools and Technologies` in helping to provide a solid 
understanding of the field.

### Principles and Practices of Software Engineering
The principles and practices of software engineering are the bedrock of our craft. This is
where we dig into the theory that undergirds our craft and the way that theory is 
applied to it. We deliberately avoid diving into the closely related field of computer
science, as that is a topic unto itself, and choose instead to focus on those 
principles and practices that are specific to software engineering.

### Soft Skills for Software Engineers
Soft skills are the skills that are not directly related to the practice of software
engineering, but are nonetheless essential to the craft. This topic is intended to
provide a repository of knowledge related to those skills, such as communication,
collaboration, and leadership.

### Tools and Technologies
Technologies may span multiple topics and subtopics, so we have chosen to place them in their
own topic. This topic is further subdivided by technology and is intended to serve as a
source of guidance on when, how, and why to use a given technology. It is not intended to be
an exhaustive list of technologies or a comprehensive guide to any one technology. Rather, it
is intended to provide a curated collection of knowledge that will help engineers to understand
and make informed decisions about the tools and technologies they use.
